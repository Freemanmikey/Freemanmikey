- 👋 Hi, I’m @Freemanmikey
- 👀 I’m interested in learning front end engineering. That is website, application and system development in short.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software engineering at ALX and I want to use the skills that I would have garnered to create a personal project that will help solve the problems faced by Farmers and Artists in particular.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on people with similar goals. Especially experienced people in designing user interfaces.
